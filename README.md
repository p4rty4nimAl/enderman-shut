# Enderman Sound Adjuster

A Minecraft Fabric mod with two main features:  

One feature seperates enderman sounds into another slider, allowing their volume to be changed relative to the default "Hostile Creatures". This is slider is seen in the first of the images.  
The other feature this mod introduces is the ability to replace the screams of hostile endermen with their passive counterparts, as highlighted in the second image below.  
This mod also adds a command with which you can interact with the slider and button, for interaction when the options screen is unavailable (/esa).
